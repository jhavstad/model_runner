Installation:

Windows users must download and install the latest versions for Pandas, Numpy, and GGPlot.  They can be found at:

Pandas v0.15.2: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas#downloads
Numpy  v1.9.1:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.9.1/
GGPlot v0.6.5:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ggplot#downloads

Mac OSX users can install the packages using Macports or Homebrew.

Linux users can use apt-get on Debian distributions or yum on RedHat distributions.

Also, there are two GUI versions, one using Tkinter and the other using QT4.
Tkinter should be installed with Python by default.  

Windows users (as well as Mac OSX and Linux users) may download PyQt4 from:

Alernatively, an install script for Mac OSX and Linux, model_runner_dep_ez_setup.py, is available to automatically install the required packages.  Windows users may run the Install.bat program to install the required packages.
